Besides the massive Englischer Garten, an extensive public park that stretches across several districts of the city, the capital of Bavaria boasts some of the most beautiful places of Germany, all just a train ride away. This is a collection of hikes in South Bavaria and Tyrol in Austria. All of the hikes can be completed in a day and are usually just one to two hours away by car or train from Munich. They should be accessible year-round, but special care should be taken during the winter months, from November to March, as the trails are likely to be fully covered in snow. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to take bug spray with you during the summer months because that\u0026rsquo;s when horseflies will be the most active. For trails around Garmisch-Partenkirchen, you should avoid hiking on the weekend if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a quieter experience, as weekdays tend to have fewer people.\n","date":"4 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/eastern-alps/","section":"Hiking in the German and Austrian Alps: my favourite day trips!","summary":"","title":"Hiking in the German and Austrian Alps: my favourite day trips!","type":"eastern-alps"},{"content":" 📍 Starting point: Walchsee Durchholzen bus station, Walchsee\n🏴 Destination: Ebbs Schanz bus station, Ebbs Concise and informative header # Introduction and some basic information about the hike and surroundings \u0026hellip; Suspendisse potenti.

Known for their diverse wildlife and microclimates, they attract all kinds of tourists from mainland Europe. The weather is mostly pleasant year-round, thanks to their proximity to mainland Africa. In fact, geographically speaking, the Canary Islands actually belong to the African continent.\nWhile the summer months can be quite hot and dry, the peak tourist seasons on the islands are usually in spring and autumn. A common weather phenomenon that leads to cloudy weather, especially in the northern part of the islands, is the trade winds. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria can often experience thick layers of clouds for weeks in a row, whereas the south of the island, Maspalomas is often scorched by the sun.\nIt’s essential to use SPF year-round, as the sun can be quite harsh, especially when you’re exposed at the top of a mountain. Two to three litres of water per person is the minimum amount you should bring on a hike lasting four hours or more.\nThe use of some of the trails below require the registration with local authorities which might come with a fee and have a limited number of slots available per day. These permits can usually be booked and paid for online.\n","date":"30 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/canary/","section":"Canary Islands ","summary":"","title":"Canary Islands ","type":"canary"},{"content":" 📍 Starting point: Bosque Encantado (La Ensillada) - El Pijaral car park/bus station, Tenerife\n🏴 Destination: (starting point)) Concise and informative header # Introduction and some basic information about the hike and surroundings \u0026hellip; Suspendisse potenti.

It wasn’t the most difficult one, nor was it the most breathtaking, but it stood out as one of the few hikes where I had the entire trail to myself for nearly four hours. To be fair, going to the mountains on a grey Thursday isn’t exactly what most people in Munich would choose to do. Even though I started quite late, I still made it out of the valley before sunset and managed to return to Munich in time for dinner. There was the occasional chamois that I crossed paths with deeper into the Höllental and some other wildlife enjoying the tranquillity of the valley.\nThe Höllental is one of the valleys around Germany’s highest peak, the Zugspitze. The valley stretches south from the Grainau municipality to the base of the mountain and is a popular trail for adventurers taking on the challenge of climbing to the 2,962-metre peak of the Zugspitze.\nThis hike is mostly a closed loop—mostly, because it doesn’t return you to the Hammersbach bus station but instead ends at another station, Kreuzeck/Alpspitzbahn, around 1.7 kilometres closer to town.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s special about this hike? # Höllentalklamm, a beautiful gorge only open from spring to autumn Variety of scenery Stunning views of the Zugspitze Some exposed sections of the trail Previous Nextsads 🚩 13.5 km point-to-point | ⌛ 5-6 hours | ↗️ 1000 meters | ↘️ 1030 meters How to get there .. # From Munich Central Railway Station, you can take a regional train that will take you to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Flixbus also operates routes between Munich and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but departs from the central bus station in Munich, rather than the central railway station.\nFrom Garmisch-Partenkirchen, you have the option to take the bus or the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway (Bayerische Zugspitzbahn) to get to Hammersbach. Buses and trains depart quite infrequently, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to plan ahead of your arrival.\nA journey from Munich Central Railway Station to Hammersbach should take around 2 hours in total. Once you finish your hike and find yourself at the Kreuzeck/Alpspitzbahn station, you can go back to Garmisch-Partenkirchen Railway Station, again by either taking the bus or the Zugspitze train.\nThe hike # The trail starts in a residential area and follows a stream, the Hammersbach, for quite a while before you ascend higher towards the valley. After climbing up the first few hundred metres or so, you will notice that the trail heads in the direction of the Höllentalklamm, a gorge through which the stream runs. It is typically only open in summer and closed in winter, which means you have to take an alternative route to go deeper into the valley instead of taking the more direct trail through the gorge.\nAfter following the steep path to the right of the entrance to the gorge, you will find yourself basically on top of the gorge. Follow the trail, and you will reach the Panoramabrücke, a bridge that spans across the valley and offers a breathtaking opportunity to marvel at the gorge from above. Cross the bridge and follow the trail further into the valley towards the Zugspitze, then take a left turn at the sign pointing towards Hupfleitenjoch, a mountain saddle in the direction of town. Halfway to the saddle, there will be a hut (Knappenhäuser), which was uninhabited at the time I was there. The remaining trail to the saddle is straightforward and offers a nice view of the valley, now from the south side.\nOnce you have reached Hupfleitenjoch, there will be the opportunity to climb a peak called Schwarzenkopf. I decided against it, as it was marked as hazardous in snowy conditions. Don’t forget to enjoy the view of Zugspitze from here!\nFollow the signs in the direction of Kreuzeckhaus and take a left turn onto Jägersteig, a steep trail that will take you back to Kreuzeck/Alpspitzbahn station.\nYou made it! 👏\nClick here for Komoot!\r","date":"30 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/eastern-alps/hoellental/","section":"Hiking in the German and Austrian Alps: my favourite day trips!","summary":"A breathtaking 13 km hike from Garmisch-Partenkirchen","title":"Höllental \u0026 Hupfleitenjoch - Germany","type":"eastern-alps"},{"content":" Celebrate with me! 🎇 # I have been wanting to create my own website for years and thanks to Hugo and Blowfish, this wish has become reality!\nThis part of the website is still under construction!

All good things in the world spring out of mutual understanding, compassion, and kindness towards one another.
