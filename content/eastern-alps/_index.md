Living in Munich for a couple of years was a real privilege. Besides the massive Englischer Garten, an extensive public park that stretches across several districts of the city, the capital of Bavaria boasts some of the most beautiful places of Germany, all just a train ride away. This is a collection of hikes in South Bavaria and Tyrol in Austria.
<br>

All of the hikes can be completed in a day and are usually just one to two hours away by car or train from Munich. They should be accessible year-round, but special care should be taken during the winter months, from November to March, as the trails are likely to be fully covered in snow. Don't forget to take bug spray with you during the summer months because that's when horseflies will be the most active.
For trails around Garmisch-Partenkirchen, you should avoid hiking on the weekend if you're looking for a quieter experience, as weekdays tend to have fewer people.
