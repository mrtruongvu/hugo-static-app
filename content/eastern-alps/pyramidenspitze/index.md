## An adventurous hike through the Kaiser Mountains that is nothing short of epic 

This is another one of the few hikes I did solo. I had just recovered from Halloween when I decided to jump on a train to Austria to climb the second-highest peak of the Kaiser Mountains. There is really nothing better than being in nature after a night out unless you had a drink or one too many. Looking for the most epic hike in the region, I came across Pyramidenspitze, a peak that involves taking an easy via ferrata section. The section isn’t particularly long but still requires surefootedness and a head for heights. Bring a helmet and some climbing gear if it makes you feel safer. It isn’t absolutely necessary, though. Ascending to the peak from Durchholzen also involves some exposed trails that have to be treated with caution.

Once you have reached the peak, you will be rewarded with a stunning panoramic view of the valley. You will probably also encounter more fellow hikers as you head back to Kufstein. Many people hike up from the west side, taking a substantially less steep route.

Make sure to leave early for this hike to avoid hiking in the dark. The last section of the hike follows a narrow and exposed trail through a dense forest. This is a point-to-point route that ends somewhere between Ebbs and Kufstein.

### What's special about this hike?
- Epic ascent with an easy via ferrata section close to the peak
- Quite steep ascent through very rugged terrain
- Beautiful mountain pines on top of the mountain
- Great for watching the sunrise

### How to get there ..
From Munich Central Railway Station, you can take a regional or intercity train to Kufstein. Be aware that you will be crossing the border into Austria, so ensure you have your documents with you.

From Kufstein station, you will need to take a bus to get to Walchsee-Durchholzen. Buses depart quite infrequently, so it’s essential to plan ahead of your arrival.

A journey from Munich Central Railway Station to Kufstein takes around 1 hour and 15 minutes, and the bus ride will add another 45 minutes to the trip. It’s a long journey, but absolutely worth it!

Once you finish your hike and find yourself somewhere between Ebbs and Kufstein, you’ll have the option to walk the 5 km distance back to Kufstein station or take a bus from the Ebbs Schanz station.

### The hike
Once you get off at the bus station at Walchsee Durchholzen, you will find yourself next to a restaurant in a small residential area. Follow Durchholzen Street and walk past the residential homes and farms. Before long, you’ll see the first yellow signs pointing towards Pyramidenspitze. From there, you will probably walk for another hour or so until the asphalt road turns into a trail. The further you walk, the closer you will get to the Winkelkar, a secluded valley with a hut in the middle.

Make sure to take a sufficient break at the hut before heading off to the next section of the hike. The remaining climb through the valley will be relatively steep all the way to the peak. Once you’ve made it past the “tree line,” the trail gets rugged and partly exposed. The final section of the ascent will involve walking on exposed trails and via ferratas, which are equipped with cables and railings. Use safety equipment if needed, and climb up the ladder to reach the peak. Congratulations—you’ve made it!

The Pyramidenspitze is probably the best place to take photos of the valley, so make sure to take out your camera before descending towards Kufstein. After your deserved rest, follow the signs to Ritzaualm, a hut further down the mountain. The remaining section follows the ridge, which is covered in mountain pines. Don’t forget to stop by the Ritzaualm hut for a hot drink and a meal.

Turn right at the hut and take a small trail into the dense forest. Some sections in the forest are quite exposed and can be slippery in autumn. Once out of the forest, follow the road that leads you to the main road next to the Inn river. Take a bus from Ebbs Schanz back to Kufstein, or walk the remaining 5 km.
