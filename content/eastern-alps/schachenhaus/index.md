## A majestic gorge, jaw-dropping views of the Reintal, and grazing cows, this hike has it all!

When I drove to Garmisch-Partenkirchen with a few university friends to hike up to the Schachenhaus, I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect on this 22 km hike. Following the recommendation of a friend, we anticipated a relaxing walk through the mountains with ample time to finish before sunset, which was around half-past nine at that time of year. Looking back, this was probably one of the most thrilling yet fun experiences I had during my time as a student in Munich.

The Schachenhaus is a hut offering overnight accommodations and a restaurant for visitors. It is located in the Wetterstein Mountains south of Garmisch-Partenkirchen (GAP). The Schachenschloss, a former residence of King Ludwig II of Bavaria situated next to the Schachenhaus, makes this route popular with visitors from both GAP and Munich.

Part of the route takes you through the Reintal, a valley often used by climbers heading for the Zugspitze, Germany‚Äôs highest mountain. The proximity to the mountain ridge, which acts as a natural border between Germany and Austria, can make the weather a bit unpredictable in summer, as different layers of air collide and cause thunderstorms or showers. On our descent from the Schachenhaus, we were caught in such a thunderstorm and had to walk in the rain all the way to the Partnachklamm.

This hike is a loop starting at the Olympic Ski Stadium in GAP and is easily accessible by train from Munich. Be sure to bring plenty of bug spray for yourself and others to avoid getting bitten by horse flies.

### How to get there
From Munich Central Railway Station, you can take a regional train to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Flixbus also operates routes between Munich and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but it departs from the central bus station in Munich, rather than the central railway station.

From Garmisch-Partenkirchen train station, it‚Äôs about a 20- to 25-minute walk to the Olympic Ski Stadium.

A journey from Munich Central Railway Station to Garmisch-Partenkirchen takes approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes in total. 

There is ample parking available right by or around the stadium.

### The hike
We came by car and parked right next to the Olympic Ski Stadium. Follow Wildenauer Stra√üe, and you‚Äôll notice the signs pointing towards the Partnachklamm‚Äîa long gorge that you need to cross on the way to Schachenhaus. Absolutely stunning in summer, the stream flowing through the gorge can quickly turn into a torrent of brown water after heavy rainfall. The entrance to the gorge is open during the day and closes in the evening. However, once inside, you will always be able to leave. There may be an entrance fee.

Once you‚Äôve made it out of the gorge, you‚Äôll come to a bifurcation where the Partnach and Ferchenbach streams merge before flowing into the gorge. This is a great spot for a refreshing dip if you fancy a quick swim. Be warned, though‚Äîthe water is freezing year-round! The path that follows the Partnach stream is where you‚Äôll be returning from. Follow the forest trail ahead, which will take you up into the Wetterstein Mountains.

This is the time to apply your insect repellent. Horseflies can be annoying in summer and are not as easy to chase away as mosquitoes. They also bite through clothes, so ensure you cover your whole body. Stop at some of the viewpoints on the way up to the Schachenhaus. Closer to the treeline, you‚Äôll likely spot grazing cows, adding to the charming vibe of the region.

Congratulations, you‚Äôve made it to the Schachenhaus and the highest point of your hike! Don‚Äôt forget to stop at the hut for some traditional Bavarian food and drinks, and take time to marvel at the Schachenschloss, built between 1869 and 1872, before heading down towards the Reintal.

Follow the trail down into the Reintal, stopping at one of the viewpoints‚Äîyou really don‚Äôt want to miss the incredible views of the valley that are sure to leave you in awe. This is the direction you‚Äôd take if you were climbing the Zugspitze. Fortunately, you‚Äôll be heading the other way, back towards the Partnachklamm gorge. Once you‚Äôve descended into the valley, simply follow the forest road until you find yourself back at the bifurcation or swimming spot.
