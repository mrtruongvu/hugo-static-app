The Canary Islands are among the first beach destinations I’ve visited in Europe. Known for their diverse wildlife and microclimates, they attract all kinds of tourists from mainland Europe. The weather is mostly pleasant year-round, thanks to their proximity to mainland Africa. In fact, geographically speaking, the Canary Islands actually belong to the African continent.<br>

While the summer months can be quite hot and dry, the peak tourist seasons on the islands are usually in spring and autumn. A common weather phenomenon that leads to cloudy weather, especially in the northern part of the islands, is the trade winds. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria can often experience thick layers of clouds for weeks in a row, whereas the south of the island, Maspalomas is often scorched by the sun.

It’s essential to use SPF year-round, as the sun can be quite harsh, especially when you’re exposed at the top of a mountain. Two to three litres of water per person is the minimum amount you should bring on a hike lasting four hours or more. 

The use of some of the trails below require the registration with local authorities which might come with a fee and have a limited number of slots available per day. These permits can usually be booked and paid for online.
