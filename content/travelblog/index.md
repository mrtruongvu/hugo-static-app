Welcome to my hiking blog! Here, you’ll find a collection of carefully curated hikes from my past adventures.



Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the endless recommendations when searching for *the* perfect hike? Picking a route that ticks all the boxes is rarely straightforward—you almost always end up combining information from multiple sources just to create a solid plan. While discovery is part of the adventure, sometimes you just want something convenient—a nature escape that seamlessly fits into your trip.




That’s exactly what I aim to provide: the perfect hiking blog posts, with just the right amount of information to get you excited. Each post includes key stats, the right photos and a link to the GPX file to ensure you stay on track.
